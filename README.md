# Linear Matrix Solver

This project is a program developed in C++ which uses Gauss-Jordan elimination to solve a system of linear equations, represented as a matrix.

The calculator is built to work with infinite/arbitrary precision, using a custom fraction data type.

As of now, the project is work in progress.
