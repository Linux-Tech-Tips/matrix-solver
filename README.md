# Matrix Solver

This project is a linear algebra adjacent side project, created in an effort to further my understanding of the algorithms behind various matrix operations, mainly Gauss-Jordan elimination.

The main component of the project is a C++ program, capable of finding the Reduced Row Echelon Form, Row Echelon Form or an Inverse of a Matrix, among others.

Along with my understanding of the maths concepts, the project was also made with the intention of improving my C++ skill in mind.

More information on this project can be found in the accompanying documentation.
